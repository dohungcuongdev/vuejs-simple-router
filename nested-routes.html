// 2. Define some routes
// Each route should map to a component. The "component" can
// either be an actual component constructor created via
// `Vue.extend()`, or just a component options object.
// We'll talk about nested routes later.
// It would be defined in step 3

// 3. Create the router instance and pass the `routes` option
// You can pass in additional options here, but let's
// keep it simple for now.
/*Note that nested paths that start with / will be treated as a root path. 
This allows you to leverage the component nesting without having to use a nested URL.
As you can see the children option is just another Array of route configuration objects 
like routes itself. Therefore, you can keep nesting views as much as you need.
At this point, with the above configuration, when you visit /user/foo, 
nothing will be rendered inside User's outlet, because no sub route is matched. 
Maybe you do want to render something there. In such case you can provide an empty subroute path:*/
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      // Child routes
      path: '/user', component: User, name: 'Admin',
      children: [
        // Child routes
        // Child, Child1,Child2 will be rendered inside User's <router-view>
        // when /user/... is matched
        { path: '', component: Child, name: 'Admin'},
        { path: '1', component: Child1, name: 'Admin1'},
        { path: '2', component: Child2, name: 'Admin2'},

        // ...other sub routes
      ]
    }
  ]
})

// 4. Create and mount the root instance.
// Make sure to inject the router with the router option to make the
// whole app router-aware.
const app = new Vue({
  router
}).$mount('#app')

// Now the app has started!
