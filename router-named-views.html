    This is where named views come in handy. Instead of having one single outlet in your view, 
    you can have multiple and give each of them a name.

        /*The default mode for vue-router is hash mode - it uses the URL hash to simulate a 
        full URL so that the page won't be reloaded when the URL changes.
        To get rid of the hash, we can use the router's history mode, which leverages 
        the history.pushState API to achieve URL navigation without a page reload:

        When using history mode, the URL will look "normal," 
        e.g. http://oursite.com/user/id. Beautiful!

        Here comes a problem, though: Since our app is a single page client side app, 
        without a proper server configuration, the users will get a 404 error 
        if they access http://oursite.com/user/id directly in their browser. Now that's ugly.

        Not to worry: To fix the issue, all you need to do is add a simple catch-all 
        fallback route to your server. If the URL doesn't match any static assets, 
        it should serve the same index.html page that your app lives in. Beautiful, again!*/
